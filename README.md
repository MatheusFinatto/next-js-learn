My first experience with Next.js, in order to know something about this innovating framework.

It's a simple home page, that can be seen on https://next-js-learn-pm2jtkok7-matheusfinatto.vercel.app/;

You will see the same homepage on localhost:3000 if you donwload this repo, run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`.
