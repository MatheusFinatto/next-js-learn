<h1>My First Experience with Next.js</h1>
<p><em>Note: The main objective of this project was to gain experience with hosting a website using Next.js, rather than developing a fully functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website.</em></p>
<p>This project was created as a learning exercise to explore the features and capabilities of Next.js, an innovative framework for building web applications. The objective of this project was not necessarily to become a Next.js developer, but rather to gain a better understanding of Vercel's serverless services and some of Next.js's paradigms.</p>
